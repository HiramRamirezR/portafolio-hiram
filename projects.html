                data-description="Developed the backend for an image processing application using Python and FastAPI. I implemented a RESTful API to manage business logic, data persistence with SQLAlchemy, and integration with the Stripe payment gateway. The system also handles server-side image manipulation using OpenCV."
                data-architecture="I chose FastAPI for the backend because of its high asynchronous performance, ideal for handling image loading and processing without blocking the server. For the database, I used SQLAlchemy for its flexibility as an ORM, which facilitates interaction with the database and allows for future engine changes (e.g., from SQLite to PostgreSQL). The integration with Stripe was key to exploring a monetization model for the project."
                data-challenges="The main technical challenge was the efficient memory management when processing large images. This led me to learn and apply image optimization techniques and to handle loading and processing operations as background tasks in FastAPI to not degrade the user experience. Another challenge was the correct implementation of the Stripe webhook to securely and reliably confirm payments.">

I used SQLModel for data modeling and interaction with a SQLite database. A key feature is the integration of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to allow task creation from simple sentences."
                data-architecture="This project uses a client-server architecture, with a Python backend (FastAPI) and a native desktop client with PySide2 (Qt). SQLModel was chosen for its modern integration of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy, simplifying database interaction and ensuring data validation. The use of a local SQLite database makes the application portable and easy to install, without external dependencies."
                data-challenges="The most interesting challenge was integrating the NLP model into the API flow to interpret natural language and convert it into structured tasks. This involved processing and validation work to handle the different ways a user can express a date or an action. In addition, establishing a smooth and efficient communication between the desktop client and the FastAPI backend was a great opportunity to learn about designing APIs for non-web browser applications.">

                data-description="Developed a Python-based backend for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The backend uses LangChain to orchestrate the interaction between a local Ollama language model and a ChromaDB vector store. It exposes an API that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content."
                data-architecture="The architecture focuses on privacy and control, using Ollama to run language models locally, avoiding dependency on third-party APIs. LangChain was chosen as the main framework to orchestrate the RAG pipeline, from loading documents with PyPDF to managing the vector database with ChromaDB. This combination allows for rapid experimentation and a robust and modular RAG system."
                data-challenges="The main challenge was optimizing the 'chunking' (text splitting) process and the generation of 'embeddings' to ensure that the context retrieved by the vector database was relevant and accurate for the user's questions. This project was fundamental to gaining practical experience with the RAG architecture, handling language models locally, and understanding how the different components (LLM, Vector Store, Embeddings) interact to create an intelligent document chat system.">

                data-architecture="The architecture of this project is a classic example of how to serve a Machine Learning model. FastAPI was used to create a robust backend that exposes the model through a REST API. For the user interface, Streamlit was chosen for its ability to create interactive data applications with very little code, allowing for rapid visualization and testing of the model. The use of a Hugging Face model demonstrates the ability to integrate and serve state-of-the-art language models."
                data-challenges="The main challenge was probably the 'fine-tuning' of the Hugging Face model to generate coherent and relevant comments for different topics. In addition, optimizing the model's inference so that the API responded quickly was an important challenge. This project allowed me to learn the complete workflow for putting an NLP model into production: from fine-tuning with PyTorch to deploying it through an API with FastAPI and creating an interactive demo with Streamlit.">
